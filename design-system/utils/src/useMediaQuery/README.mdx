# useMediaQuery

Convenient css-in-js functions for using media queries in layouts.

Reference the breakpoints in theme.

```jsx
import { useMediaQuery } from '@nathsimpson/utils';

const { mq, maxBreak, minBreak } = useMediaQuery();
```

## mq

Enables the use of responsive props anywhere.

```jsx
<div
  css={mq({
    color: ['red', 'blue']
  })}
/>
```

## maxBreak and minBreak

Helper functions for if the array property declaration of `mq` isn't appropriate.

We prefer to use `minBreak`, as the breakpoints are designed to work upwards (mobile first).

In the (hopefully rare) case max-width is needed, we have a helper for that too.

```jsx
<div
  css={{
    color: 'red',
    [minBreak('md')]: {
      color: 'blue'
    }
  }}
/>
```
