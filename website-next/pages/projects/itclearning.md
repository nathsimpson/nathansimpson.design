# ITC Learning Website

[ITC Learning](https://www.itclearning.com.au) is an eLearning Consultancy in North Sydney, comprised of 15 people. I started working at ITC Learning as a junior eLearning Developer, but my experience in web development quickly gave me the reputation of “the web guy”. After months of planning and pitching to the technology manager, I eventually convinced him that I should rebuild the company website, replacing the existing site that was built in an eLearning software and was difficult to maintain and expand.

The site is built on Wordpress, with a custom theme that is based on Bootstrap and generated using SCSS partials. The site also features custom plugins, to handle registrations for events and webinars using various APIs.
