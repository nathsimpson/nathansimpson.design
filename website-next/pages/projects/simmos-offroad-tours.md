# Simmo's Offroad Tours

Simmo's Offroad Tours is an outdoor tourism company in Orange NSW, providing winery tours, scenic 4wd tours and camping holidays in the central west of New South Wales.

It is owned by my father, who is a former Police Officer. He started the business when I was first getting interested in Graphic Design, and the business has been a great outlet for me to learn valuable skills I have used throughout my career.

Over the years, I have designed everything from the logo, to flyers, to multiple iterations of the website.

## Website

In over 10 years, the website has had multiple iterations, and has been a fantastic project for me to learn valuable development skills I have used throughout my career.

Having a project like this allows me to experiment with new ideas and technologies, while also thinking about SEO, and the experience of any potential customers using the site.

The [latest version](https://simmosoffroadtours.com) is built using React, NextJS and KeystoneJS. Keystone is a database framework which is used to maintain a calendar of upcoming tours. It produces a GraphQL API that the website interfaces with. The frontend is built using React component.

The previous version was made using a custom Wordpress theme.

## Branding

The logo was designed when I was starting to take an interest in graphic design, at 13 years old. It was originally made in Microsoft Office Publisher, but I later reconstructed it in Adobe Illustrator.

## Vehicle wrap

Designing a vinyl wrap for this LandCruiser was one of the most fun and creative projects I've worked on. I had previously completed work experience at a sign-writers in Orange, so I was familiar with the process of producing and applying graphics onto a vehicle. The result is eye catching and iconic around the Orange and Bathurst areas.

The design was completed in Adobe Illustrator, after a process of iteration over many artboards. It was then provided to the sign writers for production.

## Flyers

These flyers are in Hotels and Information Centers around the Central West region. Seeing my first box of 10,000 of these was one of the proudest moments of my life.
