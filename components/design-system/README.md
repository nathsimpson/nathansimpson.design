# Design System

I created this Design System to showcase my experience and interest in Design Systems.

It is totally open source, but is currently not published for public consumption. Instead, you can explore the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/nathsimpson/nathansimpson.design), or experiment with each of the components in their previews.

You can also see the Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/KD9brps10is6174TXk2YUY/Components?node-id=0%3A1).
