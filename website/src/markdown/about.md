# About

Greetings friend!

My name is Nathan Simpson. My friends call me Nath.

I am a frontend developer and web/mobile applications designer in Sydney Australia, passionate about Design Systems and building useful applications from concept to delivery.

Right now I'm building Design Systems and React/React-Native apps at [Thinkmill](https://thinkmill.com.au), one of the most renowned software development consultancies in Australia.

Before, I was a freelance graphic designer, helping small businesses in regional New South Wales build their websites and brands.

I was born in Orange, New South Wales, and I'm currently living in Sydney with my wife.

## History

When I was 13 years old I started developing a taste for design. I designed logos and business cards for family and small businesses in the Orange area, before transitioning into building websites in HTML and CSS. I then moved into building and managing Wordpress websites, and "accidentally" learnt some PHP through custom themes and plugins.

In 2015 I moved to Sydney and began studying the _Bachelor of Design (Visual Communication)_ from Western Sydney University, where I studied Programming Fundamentals, Web and Interactive Design, Data Visualisation, and an elective at the Sydney School of Entrepreneurship. On the side of university, I learnt Frontend Development tools like Javascript and React through Treehouse, and attended the SydJS and React Sydney meetups.
