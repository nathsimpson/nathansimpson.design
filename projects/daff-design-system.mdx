From 2021, I have been working on the [Agriculture Design System](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/) (AgDS), for the Exports Service division of the Australian Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF). AgDS exists to support product teams who are building web applications that support agricultural producers sell their products overseas.

Accessibility is a core pillar of this Design System. As a Government agency, we are required to meet the [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) accessibility standard. We have a strong commitment to inclusivity, and we are working to ensure that AgDS is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

The component library is built using React and TypeScript. We use [Storybook](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/storybook/index.html) to test, document and showcase the components, in conjunction with the [website](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/). We also use [Playroom](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/playroom/index.html) to enable co-design with Designers and Developers, using the actual components rather than static mockups.

As a Developer on the team, my role is to build and co-design new components and enhancements to AgDS, as well as a 'Design System evangelist' to help product teams adopt AgDS in their projects.

You can hear more about the project in this video on Thinkmill's YouTube channel, where I talk about the project with my colleague, Jordan Overbye.
