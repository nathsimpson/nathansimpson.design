# useMediaQuery

Convenient css-in-js functions for using media queries in layouts.

## mq

Enables the use of responsive props anywhere.

```jsx
<div
  css={mq({
    color: ['red', 'blue']
  })}
/>
```

## maxBreak and minBreak

Helper functions for if the array property declaration of `mq` isn't appropriate.

We prefer to use `minBreak`, as the breakpoints are designed to work upwards (mobile first).

In the (hopefully rare) case max-width is needed, we have a helper for that too.

```jsx
<div
  css={{
    color: 'red',
    [minBreak('md')]: {
      color: 'blue'
    }
  }}
/>
```

## mapResponsiveProp

A helper function for handling array props.

```jsx
<Box padding={['small', 'large']} />
```

```jsx
<Component css={{ marginTop: mapResponsiveProp(mt, spacing) }} />
```
