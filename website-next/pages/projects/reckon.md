# Reckon

![Balance Design System](https://files.nathansimpson.design/portfolio/reckon/reckon.jpg 'Balance Design System')

[Thinkmill](https://thinkmill.com.au) helped Reckon kick-start the next generation of their business products, for small, medium and enterprise customers.

This included a brand new design language, adopting GraphQL, building several products for web and mobile platforms, and the [Balance Design System](https://balance.reckon.com/package/getting-started).

As a frontend engineer, I was involved in developing components for Balance Web and Balance Mobile Design Systems, as well as delivering multiple web and mobile applications (to very positive customer reviews).
