I spent 6 months working at ANZ, one of Australia's big four banks, on their Horizon Design System and OceanBlue component library. During this time, I delivered several new components, and improved the design system documentation site.

The highlight was developing a new Design Token Schema, to support multiple brands - ANZ and the new ANZ Plus.
