# The Garage

The Garage was my Major Design Project for my university degree.

The purpose was to create a community where people connect through cars, and learn how to work on cars together, in a safe and friendly environment.

During the 8 months process I conducted user research, developed the Application UX design, formed the branding and built the marketing website.

I also developed a prototype of the app using React Native, with KeystoneJS for the backend. [I gave a talk about building the prototype](/talks/prototype-a-social-network) at the SydJS meetup.
