# About

Greetings friend!

I'm Nathan Simpson, but you can call me Nath.

I'm a frontend developer based Orange NSW, Australia. From conceptualisation to implementation, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between design and development to craft digital products which marry form and function.

For the past several years, I've had the privilege of honing my craft at [Thinkmill](https://thinkmill.com.au) - one of Australia's leading software development consultancies. I've worked on a diverse range of projects - From building [a Design System for the Australian Government](/projects/daff) with a strong focus on accessibility, to collaborating on mobile and web apps for small business accounting at [Reckon](/projects/reckon), and most recently, contributing to the creation of an appointment scheduling product leveraging GraphQL, I've developed a broad range of technical skills while reinforcing my product design sensibilities.

One of the aspects of my work that I find most fulfilling is the opportunity to collaborate closely with designers. By fostering an environment of open communication and mutual respect, I have been able to leverage my design background to effectively translate design concepts into functional and visually engaging user interfaces. Whether it's brainstorming ideas, providing feedback on prototypes, or iterating on designs in code, I thrive in environments where cross-disciplinary collaboration is encouraged and valued.

But beyond the code and pixels, what truly fuels my passion is the opportunity to collaborate and connect with others. I'm a natural team player, known for bringing a positive energy and enthusiasm to any squad. Whether it's mentoring junior developers, speaking at meetups, or simply brainstorming ideas with colleagues, I believe that the best solutions emerge from collective effort and shared inspiration.

When I'm not knee-deep in lines of code or pixels, you'll find me spending time with my wife, daughter and dog, tinkering with side-projects, playing soccer, or watching various forms of motorsport.

## History

My interest in design started in high-school, when I designed logos and business cards for family and local small businesses, before transitioning into building websites in HTML and CSS. I then moved into building and managing WordPress websites, and "accidentally" learned some PHP through custom themes and plugins.

This interest led me to pursue a _Bachelor of Design (Visual Communication)_ from Western Sydney University. This included electives for Programming Fundamentals, Web and Interactive Design, Data Visualization, and a unit at the Sydney School of Entrepreneurship. Alongside my university studies, I delved into Frontend Development tools like JavaScript and React through attending local meetups such as SydJS and React Sydney, and through online platforms like Treehouse.

## Speaking and Writing

Occasionally I give talks at [SydJS](https://www.sydjs.com)
and [React Sydney](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/React-Sydney) meetups. I try to post recordings of these talks on my [blog](/blog).

I also occasionally write articles on [The Apple Post](https://www.theapplepost.com/author/nathan-simpson/).
