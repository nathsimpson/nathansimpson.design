AgriVita is an iPhone Application designed to help Australian backyard-gardeners take care of their plants and animals.

Add your plants for growth and water tracking, organise them into plots, and receive reminders to water them as well as suggestions for fertilisation, weeding, or protecting them from birds or insects.

Add your animals such as pigs or chickens, and track their weight, ancestry, pregnancy, and sale history.

The app also offers a marketplace for bartering with other local farmers, and integration with AquaVita Smart irrigation products. These products will water your plants on a schedule, which will adjust depending on weather conditions, to save you water. Watering information is available at a glance, so you can compare rainfall readings alongside your irrigation system’s output.
